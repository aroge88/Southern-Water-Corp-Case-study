# Southern-Water-Corp-Case-study

# Context:

Souther Water Corp. is an Israeli water desalination company that sells fresh water for three customer segments: Residential, Public, and Private. Since the demand for agricultural and residential use is rising, Southern Water Corp. needed to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants. This has resulted in increased revenue for the calendar year. While the increase in revenue is fantastic, Southern Water Corp does not want an unsustainable rise in costs.

Costs between the various plants vary due to the type of desalinated water they produce. Residential use requires only soft water, which contains no minerals. Public and Private consumers need a mix of soft water and hard water, which contains minerals like calcium. As such, the Operational Expenses between these three plants will vary according to the production potential of desalinated water and chemical costs associated with water type. With this context in mind, management wants to understand the other side of the cost equation.

Southern Water Corp lives and dies by its cash. If costs are too high and revenue too low then the business is not sustainable. To this end, it is important to understand the revenue-to- expense ratio for all three of the desalination units (Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik). A low revenue- to-expenses ratio indicates that the unit is more expensive to operate, or in other words, there is a lower EBIT because of higher expenses.

Ultimately, my challenge as data analysts is to tell a meaningful story that drives meaningful insights. For Southern Water Corp. I be measuring my analytical success by ensuring and I can tell Southern Water Corp. a meaningful story that unpacks the EBIT, Revenues, and Operational Expenses at a macro and micro level.

     o Expense Analysis
     
     o EBITAnalysis
     
2. Economics Analysis


     o Economics Market Analysis
     
     o Economics Cost Analysis
     
     o What-If Analysis
     
 3. Statistics Analysis

    o Descriptive Statistics
    
    o Inferential Statistics
    
 4. Statistics Analysis (Python)

# Methods:


In the project, the SUMIFS function was utilized to calculate revenue, expenses, and EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes). The SUMIFS function is a powerful tool in Microsoft Excel that allows for conditional summing of values based on multiple criteria. By applying the SUMIFS function to the relevant datasets, the project team was able to accurately calculate the total revenue and expenses based on specific conditions or criteria. This allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the financial aspects of the project, providing insights into the income generated and the costs incurred under specific conditions. Moreover, by subtracting the total expenses from the total revenue using the SUMIFS function, the EBIT figure was derived. This facilitated the evaluation of the project's profitability and operational performance, accounting for various conditions and criteria. The utilization of the SUMIFS function enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of financial calculations, enabling a more detailed and insightful analysis of the project's financial performance.

In addition to utilizing the SUMIFS function for financial calculations, line and dot graphs were created to analyze economic market dynamics, cost trends, and conduct what-if analysis. Line graphs were employed to visualize the relationship between variables such as quantity, price, and revenue, providing insights into the elasticity of demand and supply within the market. By plotting these variables over time, it was possible to identify trends and patterns, distinguishing between elastic and inelastic market behavior. Dot graphs were used to display the impact of various scenarios and perform what-if analysis. Adjusting input values and observing the corresponding changes in output variables allowed for the assessment of sensitivity and potential outcomes under different conditions. These graphing techniques enhanced the project's ability to understand and interpret economic market dynamics, costs, and conduct in-depth what-if analyses, providing valuable insights for decision-making and strategic planning.

Lastly,the regression method in Excel can be utilized to obtain the mean and standard deviation as part of statistical analysis. When performing the regression analysis in Excel, the resulting output provides several statistical measures, including the mean and standard deviation. These measures can be derived from the residuals or errors in the regression model. The residuals represent the differences between the observed data points and the predicted values from the regression equation. By calculating the mean of the residuals, an estimate of the mean error can be obtained, which can serve as an approximation of the overall mean of the data. Similarly, the standard deviation of the residuals provides an estimate of the data's standard deviation. These statistics are valuable for evaluating the accuracy and variability of the regression model, as well as assessing the goodness-of-fit. Utilizing the regression method in Excel enables the derivation of important statistical measures, such as the mean and standard deviation, facilitating insightful data analysis and further exploration.
