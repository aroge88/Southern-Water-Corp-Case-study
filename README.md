# Southern-Water-Corp-Case-study

This GitHub repository contains the analysis of the case study for Southern WATER Corp. The analysis was conducted using Jupyter on three different excel files - Revenue, Economics, and Statistics. The aim of the analysis was to gain insights into the company's performance and identify potential areas for improvement.

The analysis revealed that private water was the most popular segment among the three customer segments, followed by Public and Residential Sales. Targeted expense analysis revealed that overall costs sharply increased from December, with Chemicals and Labor costs contributing significantly towards the overall cost base.

Further analysis of the Statistics data revealed interesting insights into the relationship between pump failure and pump efficiency, volumetric flow meter, and other variables. The analysis of the model fit revealed that Horse Power, Pump Speed, and Pump Torque had the largest coefficients and immediate relationship with respect to pump failure behavior.

Based on these findings, the company can take proactive measures to improve its operational efficiency and equipment reliability.

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook with the detailed analysis and findings. It can be used as a reference for similar analysis in the future.

Please feel free to view all findings with conclusions and recommendations.
